## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This project follows a **Clean Architecture** approach, separating concerns across three major layers:

### 1. Domain Layer
- Contains business logic and use cases.
- Defines models (`CharacterModel`) and use cases (`FetchCharacters`, `FilterCharacters`).

### 2. Data Layer
- Implements repositories and data sources.
- Interacts with the Rick & Morty API.
- Uses DTOs and mappers to convert data between layers.

### 3. Presentation Layer
- Contains UI logic using **Jetpack Compose**.
- Uses `ViewModel`, `StateFlow`, and `PagingData` for reactive UI.
- `CharacterListViewModel` coordinates the interaction between UI and the domain layer.

### Why This Architecture?
- Promotes testability and modularity.
- Separation of concerns simplifies long-term maintenance.
- Encourages scalability for adding new features (e.g., episodes, locations).
